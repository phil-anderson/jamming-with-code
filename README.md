Jamming With Code
=================

This is a dumping ground for code I play around with on my commute to work as a way of keeping my hand in and honing my coding skills. It's amazing what you can get written in one or two 30 minute train journeys. It's just me, an IDE, and an idea in my head. I'm not trying to get anything useful or marketable out of it, it's just done for the love of mucking about with code. It's similar to musicians getting togetehr to jam just for their own enjoyment, hence I call this kind of coding "jamming with code".

A lot of this code consists ofmy answers to coding test questions that I've found in books or on the web. Other code is just me implementing a standard algoritmfor fun, or to get a better insight into how it works.

*NOTE:* Generally this code was written for my own amusement. It shouldn't be considered  production-ready, and the quality varies depending on the mood I was in at the time / what I was trying to learn from writing it. That said, I'd like to think that I never write truly awful code. 

Enjoy!
