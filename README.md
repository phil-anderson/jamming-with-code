Jamming With Code
=================

Dumping ground for code I play around with on my commute.

A lot of this code is answers to coding test questions or implementations of algorithms done for my own amusement, and 
o hone my coding skills.

*NOTE:* Generally this code was written for my own amusement. It's non-prouction quality and in fact quality varies 
depending on the modd I was in at the time. That said, I'd like to think that I never write truly awful code.
