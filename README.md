Jamming With Code
=================

This is a dumping ground for code I play around with on my commute to work as a way of keeping my hand in and honing
my coding skills. It's amazing what you can get written in one or two 30 minute train journeys.

I'm not able to get internet on my commute so it's just me, an IDE, and an idea in my head. The lack of internet also
means I tend to just use plain old Java as I can't easily download libraries. I actually quite enjoy that limitation
though - it helps to make it all about the coding. Necessity is the mother of invention after all.

So... It's code I write simply because I love mucking about with code. It's a bit like musicians jamming for their own
enjoyment, hence the name - jamming with code.

It's mostly answers to coding test questions that I've found in books or on the web. The rest is generally me
implementing a standard algorithm or data structure to get a deeper insight into how it works.

**Caveat:** Generally this code was written for my own amusement. It shouldn't be considered  production-ready, and
the quality varies depending on the mood I was in at the time, and what I was trying to learn from writing it.
That said, I'd like to think that I never write terrible code.

Enjoy!
