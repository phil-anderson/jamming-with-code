Counting unique routes - Revisited
==================================

After finishing the last exercise (number-of-routes) I realised that there was a more efficient algorithm hiding
behind the code. I realised that if I just focused on building the results cache, I'd arrive at the same answer, and
that I could do so with a simple nested loop, hence none of the stack issues and O(N2) performance of recursion.

It ended up only taking about 15 minutes, and I wished I'd done it this way in the first place - The beauty of 20/20
hindsight eh?
