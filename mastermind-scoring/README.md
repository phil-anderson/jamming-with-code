MasterMind Scorer
=================

Some code to handle scoring for the board game mastermind (google will enlighten you if you're not familiar with it).

This was relatively straightforward to write as a single procedural class with lots of state and not much structure,
but it was then surprisingly hard to refactor it into something more OO, and the lines of code count rocketed!

I'm still not entirely happy with the result and am beginning to come to the conclusion that some code - particularly
code that performs a single function - simply doesn't lend itself to an OO approach. I'd love to see if somebody else
has put togeather a really nice OO version of it though.
