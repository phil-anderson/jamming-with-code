Sample binary tree implementation
=================================

This is a binary tree implementation I put together just because I was interested to see if I could without looking up
sample code or reading up on the algorithms.

It was mostly pretty straightforward but remove() was a real pig, both to work out how to code, and then to implement.
It seemed like corner-cases kept appearing and trying to keep the code tidy and under control while still having a
decent implementation was a challenge.

Still... I got there in teh end, and now have a much better innate understanding of how BTrees work.
