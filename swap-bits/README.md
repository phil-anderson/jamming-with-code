Swap even and odd bits of an int
================================

Some simple code to swap the even and odd bits of an int using bitwise operations.

I thought I'd give it a go on the grounds that it surely must be harder than it appeared but it wasn't really
other than being sure to use >>> and not >> although I guess that might have been the point of the question.
