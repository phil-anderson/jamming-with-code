Quicksort Implementation
========================

I thought I'd have a go at writing a quicksort algorithm. It turns out that it's all about partitioning around
a pivot value and then recursing... Simple!

Unfortunately it proved nowhere near as simple to implement as I'd thought. In fact it's fair to say it was a nightmare.

Don't let the shortness of the code fool you... Every line of it was hard-won!
